## What is it?
Back-end server application that uses express routes, knex and postgres to provide read and write access to the data tier.  

## Why?
Build a real-world back-end server that delivers REST API end-points with connectivity to a database and validation.

## My Focus
The focus on this exercise was to build the required migration scripts to create database tables. Then, create express routeS that define allowed API end points.  The API end points provide middleware validation, connectivity to the data layer, and result data formatting.  The data layer uses the KNEX Query Builder to read from and write to Postgres database tables.  Implemented database capability includes select, update, and delete to return json objects.  Map-properties and reduce-properties functions use LODASH to condense the json output as needed.
